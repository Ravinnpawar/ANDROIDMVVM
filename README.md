## Description
The Android MVVM Application demonstrates the implementation of the MVVM architecture pattern in an Android app. MVVM is a software architectural pattern that separates the user interface (View) from the business logic and data (Model), using a ViewModel as an intermediary. This separation of concerns enhances testability, maintainability, and reusability.

The application showcases the following components and concepts:
- View layer: Activities and Fragments responsible for displaying UI and handling user interactions.
- ViewModel layer: ViewModel classes that hold the UI-related data and business logic.
- Model layer: Repository classes that abstract the data sources and provide data to the ViewModel.
- Data binding: Utilizing data binding to establish a connection between the View and ViewModel.
- LiveData: Using LiveData to observe and react to data changes in a lifecycle-aware manner.
- Dependency Injection: Implementing dependency injection for managing dependencies and promoting modularity.
